<p>1 - Introduction</p>
<p>Airbnb, Inc. is an American San Francisco-based company operating an
online marketplace for short-term homestays and experiences. The company
acts as a broker and charges a commission from each booking. The company
was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk, and Joe Gebbia.
Airbnb is a shortened version of its original name,
AirBedandBreakfast.com. The company has been the subject of criticism
for lack of regulations and enabling increases in home rents. Nowadays,
is a popular website amongst travelers all around the world and many
times can be used as a substitute for traditional hotels. Since it’s an
user-to-user website, it’s the users themselves who get in contact with
each other and set up details about their stay. The website also
provides an user review system - both for the contractors and lessees.
The website provides some official data that can be obtained in
“<a href="http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/" class="uri">http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/</a>” and the data used in this
analysis is taken from December 29th, 2022. All of the files used in
this analysis are provided in my github.</p>
<p>I used the website before and then became curious as to the number of
available places for rent in famous cities across the world. For this
analysis, I used the data from the following cities: Tokyo (Japan),
London (United Kingdom), Paris (France), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and
Shanghai (China). The data can be obtained in the approachable CSV
format, so I decided to use SQL to better glance at the data and to
filter it effectively. The SQL tool I used for this is “DB Browser for
SQLite”.</p>
<p>2 - Getting into the data</p>
<p>At first I was curious about only the city of Tokyo, which is where I
live. From my own personal life experience, I noticed not so many people
opt to choose an Airbnb location when they come to Tokyo, prefering
staying in hotels. So my first question was:</p>
<p>“How many available locations are there in Tokyo?”</p>
<p>This can be accessed by the simple query:</p>
<p>SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT id) FROM tokyolistings</p>
<p><img src="images/tokyototalquantity.jpg" /></p>
<p>The result seemed surprisingly small, given the sheer size of Tokyo. We
will come back to this result later. I then proceeded to the question</p>
<p>“What are the most concentrated neighbourhoods in Tokyo?, i.e. the ones
which have the most amount of airbnb locations?”</p>
<p>For this, I used the Following query</p>
<p>SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT id) as Number , neighbourhood_cleansed<br />
FROM tokyolistings<br />
GROUP BY neighbourhood_cleansed<br />
ORDER BY Number DESC;</p>
<p><img src="images/tokyobyregion.jpg" /></p>
<p>The result was somewhat expected, with the district of Shinjuku being
the most popular, followed by Taito. Shinjuku is the most populated
region of Tokyo and it is a central hub for transportation within the
metropolis, also having a Bullet Train station.</p>
<p>Now comes a very important question for those who are interested in
traveling:</p>
<p>“What is the price average for each Neighbourhood?”</p>
<p>Given some variables, such as size, type of location - entire apartment,
single room, etc -, and other amenities, the price can vary wildly
between the same neighbourhood. However, by determining the average, we
can find overall good neighbourhoods to look into. We can filter those
by both price and location at the same time.</p>
<p>SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT id) as number_of_locations,
neighbourhood_cleansed as neighbourhood, ROUND(AVG(CAST(REPLACE(price,
‘$’, ’’) AS INT))) as average_price FROM tokyolistings<br />
GROUP BY neighbourhood<br />
ORDER BY number_of_locations DESC;</p>
<p><img src="images/tokyoavgpriceplace.jpg" /></p>
<p>Because the result was being skewed because of the “$” symbol and for
the fact that the “price” column was a string, we need a way to convert
it to a numeric value so that the analysis can go on without errors. We
will also round the values With this query, we will even show which
neighbourhood is the most expensive in descending order. For us to show
starting from the cheapest to most expensive, we can simply replace the
last line with</p>
<p>ORDER BY number_of_locations ASC;</p>
<p>This gave us an interesting result, however we need to consider some
factors in this step. First, we are not so sure about the currency in
which the data is provided. “$” stands for the dollar symbol and the
average price per region seems somewhat reasonable in dollars, however
checking the data can show us some odd values, to say the least.</p>
<p><img src="images/tokyopricecolumnweird.jpg" /></p>
<p>Here, some values seem to defy common sense. While it’s true that
websites such as ebay or airbnb, where is the owner who regulates the
price of the product, many people seem to input values beyond the common
sense. The opposite of too expensive can also be seen in the image
bellow, where some values are simply “zero”.</p>
<p><img src="images/tokyopriceascending.jpg" /></p>
<p>Part of a job of an analyst is to evaluate the quality and integrity of
the data, and try to work around or understand when such oddities
happen. Some things might be simply input errors from the analyst, but
many times it could be just inconsistent data from the source, so we
need to be careful about that.</p>
<p>Also, while the maximum and minimum values seem absurd, the “average”
values also seem a bit odd if they are to be taken in dollars.
Organizing the data by ascending price can show us checking the table
that there are too many high values in dollars, which seems a bit too
overpriced, even though Tokyo has the fame of being an expensive city.
We can also assume that the values are in the japanese Yen, where
numbers tend to go higher than in dollars or euros. For example, the
average price of 130 yen more or less equals to 1 dollar. The highest
bill in Japan is that of 10.000 Yen, which is roughly valued at around
75US$ at the date of this analysis.</p>
<p>Looking at all of this, we can go to the next step in our analysis.</p>
<p>3 - Comparisons</p>
<p>Since the number of results in Tokyo seemed relatively small for such a
massive city. According to various sources, including
<a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-city-rankings/largest-metro-areas-in-the-world" class="uri">https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-city-rankings/largest-metro-areas-in-the-world</a>
Tokyo has the most populated metropolitan region in the world. Less than
10 thousand airbnb locations just sounds so little. Then I’ve decided to
investigate into other famous and populated metropolitan areas to
establish comparisons. I’ve decided to analyze the following cities
across the world: New York, Paris, London, Rio de Janeiro and Shanghai.
For each city, for the sake of simplicity and speed, we can just glimpse
over the data quickly using just two queries: quantity of total
available places and then the division by price in each neighbourhood.
Let’s start with New York.</p>
<p>For a quick reminder, this would be the query for this case</p>
<p>SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT id) as number_of_locations FROM newyorklistings</p>
<p><img src="images/newyorktotallocations.jpg" /></p>
<p>The total result was more than four times that of Tokyo, which is
impressive. Now let’s see the price divided by neighbourhood.</p>
<p><img src="images/newyorkaverageprices.jpg" /></p>
<p>Here, we can see the appearance of a NULL value within the
neighbourhoods. This might be by some factors, but it most likely could
be by the users not quite knowing in which neighbourhood their place was
located or having no applicable value. Since the number of NULL values
for neighbourhood is too high, it would not be a good idea to remove it
from the analysis. A glance at the “price” column can show us that the
values seem a bit more reasonable than Tokyo if in dollars, however one
must wonder why these values are in a string format and not in numeric
in the first place.</p>
<p>Now, for the sake of brevity, let’s do all the operations in the
remaining cities.<br />
<br />
Paris</p>
<p><img src="images/parisnumber.jpg" /></p>
<p><img src="images/parisaverageprice.jpg" /></p>
<p>London</p>
<p><img src="images/londonnumber.jpg" /></p>
<p><img src="images/londonavgpriceperneighbourhoodupdated.jpg" /></p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro</p>
<p><img src="images/rionumber.jpg" /></p>
<p><img src="images/rioaverageprice.jpg" /></p>
<p>And finally, Shanghai, which was a surprise</p>
<p><img src="images/shangaianalysis.jpg" /></p>
<p>A whooping zero. I did a better investigation on the data to see if I
had made some sort of mistake when importing the files.</p>
<p><img src="images/shangaianalysis2.jpg" /></p>
<p>Then I’ve decided to take a look on the file itself. Since it is a CSV
file, you can open it with a text editor.</p>
<p><img src="images/shangaianalysis3.jpg" /></p>
<p>The final results had some interesting points, that could have a list of
their own:</p>
<p>1 - The Shanghai data was empty, even looking at the txt document showed
us there is no data there. Even another data provided in the website had
the same result. Unfortunately, we are prone to faulty data in this line
of work.</p>
<p>2 - It was surprising to see that London had the most listings of all of
the locations, even more than Paris. While London is also a great
tourist attraction, you would imagine Paris would the the number 1 in
popularity. This could be an interesting case on studying data bias and
how some assumptions can be disproven with data.</p>
<p>3 - Rio de Janeiro has a huge amount of available places, but the sheer
amount available in Copacabana - while also having a huge average
price - was surprising. It is a region known to be one of the most
expensive in the city, while also attracting many and many tourists. It
would be interesting to look it up further on the topic, but we can do
so another time.</p>
<p>Now we can come again to our initial question on this portion: if Tokyo
is so massive, why does it have so few locations available? This is
where the analyst job needs to be more investigative. Cold data can lead
to many interesting points, but context is very important in any
analysis. We could assume at first glance that maybe the culture of
Airbnb doesn’t particularly suits the japanese public, or the
traditional hotel industry has too much of a hold on the city. However,
a simple search can show us a more detailed result as to why, explained
well across the internet in traveling blogs and news outlets. It
basically sums down to a change in regulation in 2018 regarding Airbnb
and lodgings in Japan requiring a license. Many have dropped from the
site because of this new regulation, making it unviable. Like this, we
can see how huge of an impact local legislation and other practices can
have on global businesses, even on established brands and services.</p>
<p>4 - Conclusion</p>
<p>Airbnb is not so popular in Japan compared to other locations around the
world, but it seems a traveling person shouldn’t have much problem while
looking for a place in Tokyo. As it would be the case with many
person-to-person offering, it would be a good idea do investigate a
potential logging well before deciding, as some places seem to have
weird prices or other untrustworthy conditions.</p>
